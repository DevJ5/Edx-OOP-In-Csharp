- Encapsulation is including all behaviours and attributes in the class itself. And it also means data hiding, i.e. using private fields and getters/setters as an interface to the outside.
- Inheritance is having a sub class inherit behaviours and attributes from a base class. Reasoning is abstraction (we dont see the implementation details) and not repeating the same code.
- Polymorphism is often expressed as 'one interface, multiple functions'. 
Static polymorphism is done via:
1) Function overloading, having multiple functions with the same name and different parameters. 
2) Operator overlaoding, with the operator keyword followed by an operator (operator+)
Dynamic polymorphism is done via:
1) abstract classes with abstract methods that need to be implemented.
2) abstract classes with virtual methods that can be overridden.
- Abstraction is the process of hiding certain information to the user and can be done with abstract classes (which cant be instantiated) and abstract methods (which are not yet implemented, just a signature)


_A framework is just a bunch of code that a programmer can call without having to write it explicitly._ -Me
