- Encapsulation is including all behaviours and attributes in the class itself. And it also means data hiding, i.e. using private fields and getters/setters as an interface to the outside.
- Inheritance is having a sub class inherit behaviours and attributes from a base class. Reasoning is abstraction (we dont see the implementation details) and not repeating the same code.
