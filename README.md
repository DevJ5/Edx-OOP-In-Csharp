# Edx-OOP-In-Csharp
- Encapsulation is including all behaviours and attributes in the class itself. And it also means data hiding, i.e. using private fields and getters/setters as an interface to the outside.
- Inheritance is having a sub class inherit behaviours and attributes from a base class. Reasoning is abstraction (we dont see the implementation details) and not repeating the same code.
- Polymorphism is often expressed as 'one interface, multiple functions'. 
Static polymorphism is done via:
1) Function overloading, having multiple functions with the same name and different parameters. 
2) Operator overlaoding, with the operator keyword followed by an operator (operator+)
Dynamic polymorphism is done via:
1) abstract classes with abstract methods that need to be implemented.
2) abstract classes with virtual methods that can be overridden.
